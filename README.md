# usb-descriptors-project
Our mission!  Catalog all known USB descriptors/etc. in a semantic (programmatically-accessible) format! :D<br/>
(an example of the "etc." is USB Video Class "Controls" which are basically the same as "Descriptors" but go either direction, not just Device-to-Host!)

The format used is [structlan](https://github.com/PuppyPi/structlan/wiki) (which was created for this project! but can be used in many other binary formats).
