		This section defines the device-level Container ID descriptor which shall be implemented by
		all USB hubs, and is optional for other devices. If this descriptor is provided when operating
		in one mode, it shall be provided when operating in any mode. T his descriptor may be used
		by a host in order to identify a unique device instance across all operating modes. If a
		device can also connect to a host through other technologies, the same Container ID value
		contained in this descriptor should also be provided over those other technologies in a
		technology specific manner.
