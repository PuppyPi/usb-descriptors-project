				The address of the endpoint on the USB device described by this descriptor. The address is encoded as follows:
				Bit 3...0, The endpoint number
				Bit 6...4, Reserved, reset to zero
				Bit 7, Direction, ignored for control endpoints
				0 = OUT endpoint

				01 = Isochronous
				10 = Bulk
				11 = Interrupt
				If not an isochronous endpoint, bits 5..2 are reserved and must be set to zero. If isochronous, they are defined as follows:
				Bits 3..2, Synchronization Type
				00 = No Synchronization
				01 = Asynchronous
				10 = Adaptive

				Bits 5..4, Usage Type
				00 = Data endpoint

				11 = Reserved
				Refer to Chapter 5 for more information.
				All other bits are reserved and must be reset to zero.
				Reserved bits must be ignored by the host."

		["u16l", "wMaxPacketSize", "
				Maximum packet size this endpoint is capable of sending or receiving when this configuration is selected.
				For isochronous endpoints, this value is used to reserve the bus time in the schedule, required for the per-(micro)frame data payloads. The pipe may, on an ongoing basis, actually use less bandwidth than that reserved. The device reports, if necessary, the actual bandwidth used via its normal, non-USB defined mechanisms.
				For all endpoints, bits 10..0 specify the maximum packet size (in bytes).
				For high-speed isochronous and interrupt endpoints:
				Bits 12..11 specify the number of additional transaction opportunities per microframe:
				00 = None (1 transaction per microframe)
				01 = 1 additional (2 per microframe)
				10 = 2 additional (3 per microframe)
				11 = Reserved
				Bits 15..13 are reserved and must be set to zero.
				Refer to Chapter 5 for more information."

		["u8", "bInterval", "
				Interval for polling endpoint for data transfers.
				Expressed in frames or microframes depending on the device operating speed (i.e., either 1 millisecond or 125 μs units).
				For full-/high-speed isochronous endpoints, this value must be in the range from 1 to 16. The bInterval value is used as the exponent for a 2^(bInterval-1) value; e.g., a bInterval of 4 means a period of 8 (2^(4-1))
				For full-/low-speed interrupt endpoints, the value of this field may be from 1 to 255.
				For high-speed interrupt endpoints, the bInterval value is used as the exponent for a 2^(bInterval-1) value; e.g., a bInterval of 4 means a period of 8 (2^(4-1)). This value must be from 1 to 16.
				For high-speed bulk/control OUT endpoints, the bInterval must specify the maximum NAK rate of the endpoint. A value of 0 indicates the endpoint never NAKs. Other values indicate at most 1 NAK each bInterval number of microframes. This value must be in the range from 0 to 255.
				See Chapter 5 description of periods for more detail."
