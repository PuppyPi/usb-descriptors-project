				Configuration characteristics
				D7, Reserved (set to one)
				D6, Self-powered
				D5, Remote Wakeup
				D4...0, Reserved (reset to zero)
				D7 is reserved and must be set to one for historical reasons.
				
				A device configuration that uses power from the bus and a local source reports a non-zero value in bMaxPower to indicate the amount of bus power required and sets D6. The actual power source at runtime may be determined using the GetStatus(DEVICE) request (see Section 9.4.5).
				
				If a device configuration supports remote wakeup, D5 is set to one.

		["u8", "bMaxPower", "
				Maximum power consumption of the USB device from the bus in this specific configuration when the device is fully operational. Expressed in 2 mA units (i.e., 50 = 100 mA).
				Note, A device configuration reports whether the configuration is bus-powered or self-powered. Device status reports whether the device is currently self-powered. If a device is disconnected from its external power source, it updates device status to indicate that it is no longer self-powered.
				A device may not increase its power draw from the bus, when it loses its external power source, beyond the amount reported by its configuration.
				If a device can continue to operate when disconnected from its external power source, it continues to do so. If the device cannot continue to operate, it fails operations it can no longer support. The USB System Software may determine the cause of the failure by checking the status and noting the loss of the deviceâ€™s power source.
